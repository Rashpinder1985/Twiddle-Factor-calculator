# Twiddle Factor Calculator

## Overview
The **Twiddle Factor Calculator** is an interactive tool to visualize cosine (cos θ) and sine (sin θ) values on the unit circle. It’s ideal for understanding trigonometric patterns and quadrant-based sign conventions, commonly used in mathematics and signal processing.

## Features
- **Angle Selection**:
  - Choose angles as multiples of π/8, π/4, or π/2.
  - Adjust the count of angles (1 to 50) for flexible visualization.
- **Sign Convention**:
  - Observe how cos θ and sin θ values change across quadrants.
- **Interactive Learning**:
  - Great for students, educators, and professionals working in Fourier transforms or DSP.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd twiddle-factor-calculator
   ```
3. Run the application (instructions vary based on implementation).
